## Self-Evaluation Checklist

Tick the boxes (i.e., fill them with 'X's) that apply to your submission:

- I successfully implemented and tested the following exercises:
  - Part 1: Symbolic Arithmetic Expressions
    - [X] 1 (Pretty Printing)
    - [X] 2 (Symbolic Differentiation)
    - [X] 3 (Simplification)
    - [X] 4 (Map and Fold)
  - Part 2: Lambda Calculus Interpreter
    - [X] 5 (Free Variables)
    - [X] 6 (Substitution)
    - [X] 7 (Applicative-Order Evaluation)

## Summary and Reflection

I enjoyed the clean fit between algebraic data types, pattern matching, and recursive transforms; fold_expr made it pleasant to define generic traversals.

It was challenging getting substitution exactly right with capture avoidance and picking a safe fresh name set. Also deciding how far to take simplify without drifting into full algebraic normalization.

If I was starting over, Iâ€™d add a small fixpoint helper for simplify and a tiny constant-folding pass (for Add(Const a, Const b) and Mul(Const a, Const b)) to make the REPL demos cleaner.
